#Starter Code for <br> Microsoft Cognitive Services: <br> Image Content Analysis

***
## Introduction

  Currently there is no official R package for calling Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs from R. The Microsoft Cognitive Services API is a standard REST API which can be called by using the httr package. Input and output are standard JSON, which we can create and extract using the jsonlite package.

Image Content Analysis feature is powered by the Computer Vision API. It returns information about visual content found in an image. The algorithms use tagging, descriptions and domain-specific models to identify content and label it with confidence.

Here are some cool applications developed in R which are run by the powerful Microsoft Cognitive services algorithms.
