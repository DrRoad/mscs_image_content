#Image Content Analysis

***
## Introduction

This feature returns information about visual content found in an image. The algorithms use tagging, descriptions and domain-specific models to identify content and label it with confidence.

Here are some cool applications developed in R which are powered by the Microsoft Cognitive services algorithms.

***

## Starter Code
